# Permissions_sample

One more sample of requesting permissions for new Android Marshamallow model

Compare MainActivity and MainActivity2 to find some main difference.

Note:
I don't know why android do not throw SecurityException when we try to get account info without requesting permissions. But I beleive he should.
